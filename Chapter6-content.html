<p><strong>Conclusion:  A Final Movement</strong></p>
<p>
The Cosmic Bowel Hypothesis reframes the black hole-white hole cycle through a
digestive metaphor. It is humorous, yes—but also pedagogically effective. It ties together
intake, compression, entropy, pressure, and output in a form anyone with a body can
understand.</p>
<p>
Whether or not white holes exist, the CBH model makes one thing clear:
Even the universe can't hold it in forever.</p>

A conceptual diagram illustrating the CBH model. The black hole functions as a cosmic
'mouth,' with matter passing through the event horizon and singularity (compression),
before travelling through spacetime and reemerging via a reactive white hole 'anus.'
Hawking radiation is not shown but is considered analogous to a thermodynamic burp.</p>
