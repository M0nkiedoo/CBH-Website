1.Introduction: The Digestive Universe

Black holes remain among the most fascinating and perplexing entities in theoretical
physics. Their ability to consume matter, warp spacetime, and seemingly erase
information has invited not only intense scientific scrutiny but also rich metaphorical
speculation. Among the more elusive mirror phenomena proposed by general relativity
are white holes—time-reversed black holes that expel matter but cannot be entered.
Despite their mathematical consistency, white holes remain unobserved and are
considered highly unstable, leading some to question their physical reality.
Yet what if this instability is not a flaw but a feature? What if white holes do not persist in
spacetime like their darker counterparts, but emerge only when needed, functioning as
reactive outputs rather than continuous fixtures? To frame this idea, we turn not to
quantum field theory or differential geometry, but to biology.
We propose a novel and semi-satirical interpretive model: the Cosmic Bowel Hypothesis
of Gravitational Thermodynamics (CBH Model). In this framework, black holes act as the
intake or "mouth" of the universe, singularities serve as digestive compressive zones,
and white holes represent intermittent expulsions of reprocessed cosmic matter—not
unlike the final phase of digestion.
While irreverent on the surface, this metaphor provides a surprisingly functional lens for
understanding the behavior of black holes, the elusive role of white holes, and the flow of
information in a curved, thermodynamically bound universe.
