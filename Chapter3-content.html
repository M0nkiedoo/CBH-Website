</p>3. Activation Conditions for White Hole Ejection

</p>
<p>
One of the persistent issues with traditional white hole theory is that they appear to be
mathematically valid but physically absurd. A permanent white hole would be: constantly
ejecting matter, defying thermodynamic stability, and collapsing immediately. The CBH
model resolves this by framing the white hole as an intermittent feature, not a static one.

<strong>White Holes as Pressure-Triggered Events</strong> 
</p>

<p>
Matter is ingested by the black hole, compressed at or near the singularity, and held until
a threshold condition is met—mass, entropy density, or spacetime curvature. At that
point, the “cosmic sphincter” opens.</p>

<p>
<strong>Loop Quantum Gravity and Bounce Cosmology</strong>
</p>

<p>
Certain quantum gravity models replace the singularity with a bounce, suggesting matter
rebounds and emerges as an expanding white hole. CBH frames this as a pressure-
release mechanism.</p>

<p>
<strong>Biological Analogy</strong></p>

<p>
Biology shows that continuous intake without output is fatal. CBH echoes this: black
holes consume, compress, and eventually expel. White holes are essential to cosmic
health.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cosmic Constipation Hypothesis</strong>
</p>

<p>
If no white hole forms, Hawking radiation becomes the fallback—slow, inefficient, and
comparable to cosmic indigestion.</p>
