<p>4. The Information Paradox, Fibre, and Spacetime Regularity</p>

<p>
At the heart of black hole thermodynamics lies the information paradox. In CBH, this
becomes: does the universe get enough fibre?</p>

<p>
4.1. Information = Fibre:</p>

<p>
Information helps transport and retain structure. Without enough of it, black holes
accumulate unrelieved entropy.</p>

<p>
4.2. White Holes as Information Restorers:</p>

<p>
White holes may return scrambled quantum states—like waste still containing the trace
of its source.</p>

<p>
4.3. Spacetime Regularity:</p>

<p>
Singularities are the breakdowns of structure—CBH suggests this is due to irregular
information flow and lack of connective topologies.</p>

<p>
4.4. Quantum Flatulence:</p>

<p>
Hawking radiation may represent quantum burps—tiny bits of information escaping over
long durations.</p>
