<strong><p>The Information Paradox, Fibre, and Spacetime Regularity</p>
</strong>
<p>
At the heart of black hole thermodynamics lies the information paradox. In CBH, this
becomes: does the universe get enough fibre?</p>

<p>
<strong>Information = Fibre:</p>
</strong>
<p>
Information helps transport and retain structure. Without enough of it, black holes
accumulate unrelieved entropy.</p>
<p>
<strong>White Holes as Information Restorers:</p>
</strong>
<p>
White holes may return scrambled quantum states—like waste still containing the trace
of its source.</p>
<strong><p>Spacetime Regularity:</p>
</strong>
<p>
Singularities are the breakdowns of structure—CBH suggests this is due to irregular
information flow and lack of connective topologies.</p>
<strong><p>Quantum Flatulence:</p>
</strong>
<strong><p>Hawking radiation may represent quantum burps—tiny bits of information escaping over
long durations.</p>
