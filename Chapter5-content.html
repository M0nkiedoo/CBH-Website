<p>5. Predictions and Speculations</p>

<p>
5.1. White Holes as Ejections:</p>

<p>
White holes might appear observationally as gamma-ray bursts or high-energy outflows
—short-lived cosmic bowel movements.</p>

<p>
5.2. Universe Seeding:</p>

<p>
White holes may birth new universes. Our universe may be the ejected product of
another’s cosmic backend.</p>

<p>
5.3. Multiversal Digestive Chain:</p>

<p>
Each universe contains black holes which may give rise to others—a galactic bowel
movement chain of spacetime digestion.</p>

<p>
5.4. Observational Possibilities:</p>
Anomalous gamma bursts, entropy jets, or gravitational hiccups might support CBH.
