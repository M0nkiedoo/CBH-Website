<p><strong>Predictions and Speculations</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>White Holes as Ejections</strong></p>
<p>
White holes might appear observationally as gamma-ray bursts or high-energy outflows
—short-lived cosmic bowel movements.</p>
<p>
<strong>Universe Seeding</strong></p>
<p>
White holes may birth new universes. Our universe may be the ejected product of
another’s cosmic backend.</p>
<p>
<strong>Multiversal Digestive Chain</strong></p>
<p>
Each universe contains black holes which may give rise to others—a galactic bowel
movement chain of spacetime digestion.</p>
<p>
<strong>Observational Possibilities</strong>
</p>
<p>Anomalous gamma bursts, entropy jets, or gravitational hiccups might support CBH.
