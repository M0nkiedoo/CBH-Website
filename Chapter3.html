3. Activation Conditions for White Hole Ejection

One of the persistent issues with traditional white hole theory is that they appear to be
mathematically valid but physically absurd. A permanent white hole would be: constantly
ejecting matter, defying thermodynamic stability, and collapsing immediately. The CBH
model resolves this by framing the white hole as an intermittent feature, not a static one.

3.1. White Holes as Pressure-Triggered Events:

Matter is ingested by the black hole, compressed at or near the singularity, and held until
a threshold condition is met—mass, entropy density, or spacetime curvature. At that
point, the “cosmic sphincter” opens.

3.2. Loop Quantum Gravity and Bounce Cosmology:

Certain quantum gravity models replace the singularity with a bounce, suggesting matter
rebounds and emerges as an expanding white hole. CBH frames this as a pressure-
release mechanism.

3.3. Biological Analogy:

Biology shows that continuous intake without output is fatal. CBH echoes this: black
holes consume, compress, and eventually expel. White holes are essential to cosmic
health.

3.4. The Cosmic Constipation Hypothesis:

If no white hole forms, Hawking radiation becomes the fallback—slow, inefficient, and
comparable to cosmic indigestion.
