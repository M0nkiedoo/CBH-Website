5. Predictions and Speculations

5.1. White Holes as Ejections:

White holes might appear observationally as gamma-ray bursts or high-energy outflows
—short-lived cosmic bowel movements.

5.2. Universe Seeding:

White holes may birth new universes. Our universe may be the ejected product of
another’s cosmic backend.

5.3. Multiversal Digestive Chain:

Each universe contains black holes which may give rise to others—a galactic bowel
movement chain of spacetime digestion.

5.4. Observational Possibilities:

Anomalous gamma bursts, entropy jets, or gravitational hiccups might support CBH.
