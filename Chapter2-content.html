<p><strong>The Anatomy of Spacetime Digestion</strong>
</p>
<p>
In the CBH Model, the dynamics of black holes and their hypothetical white hole
counterparts are mapped onto the functional anatomy of a digestive tract. While the
analogy is playful, it offers a surprisingly cohesive model of input, transformation,
storage, pressure buildup, and eventual expulsion.

<p>	
	<strong>The Black Hole — The Mouth:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Like the beginning of a digestive system, the black hole serves as the intake port. Matter,
energy, light, and information are pulled across the event horizon, never to return. The
event horizon functions like a sphincter or one-way valve, allowing inflow but preventing
any exit.

<p>
	<strong>The Singularity — The Stomach:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The singularity represents the most extreme condition of compression, reducing matter
to its most fundamental states.2.3. Hawking Radiation — The Burp:
Hawking radiation provides a thermodynamic release valve. It’s weak and slow—like gas
escaping over time.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>The White Hole — The Anus:</strong>

</p>
<p>
When enough gravitational “mass-pressure” builds, a white hole event emerges,
expelling restructured matter in an explosive, time-reversed flow.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Wormhole Hypothesis — The Intestine:</strong>
</p>
<p>
In CBH terms, this is the intestine—a transit tube that processes compressed matter into
a more stable, ejection-ready form.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Information Paradox — The Fibre Question:</strong>
</p>
<p>
If white holes eject previously compressed contents, they may resolve the information
paradox—not by preventing information loss, but by delaying its return until the ejection
event.
