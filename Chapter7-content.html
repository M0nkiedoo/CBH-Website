<p><strong>The First Flush - Was the Big Bang a White Hole?</strong>
</p>

<p>
One of the more compelling implications of the Cosmic Bowel Hypothesis is its alignment with certain speculative cosmological models that propose a radical idea: the Big Bang itself was a white hole event. 
In traditional physics, the Big Bang is treated as the origin of space, time, and matter—a kind of absolute beginning. But recent theories in loop quantum gravity and bounce cosmology suggest a different picture. Rather than emerging from nothing, the universe may be the result of a prior collapse—a rebound triggered by the implosion of a black hole in another universe.

In this interpretation, the Big Bang was not a beginning, but an ejection: a violent discharge of compressed matter and energy from the other side of a singularity. This “bounce” may correspond to the pressure-triggered white hole events central to the CBH model. Where traditional cosmology sees a creation event, CBH sees the ultimate cosmic bowel movement.

The implications are immense. If white holes seed new universes, then every black hole in our cosmos could be gestating the birth of another. This leads to the notion of a digestive multiverse—one where each universe is linked by a gravitational intestinal tract, with matter compressed and expelled in a continuous cycle of cosmogenesis.

Thus, CBH frames the Big Bang not as a miraculous explosion, but as the universe’s “First Flush”—an expulsion that cleared the cosmic pipes and made room for everything that followed.
