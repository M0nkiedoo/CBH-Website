Abstract

We propose the Cosmic Bowel Hypothesis (CBH), a biologically inspired metaphor for
black hole–white hole dynamics rooted in gravitational thermodynamics and quantum
gravity. In this model, black holes function as the mouths of the universe—ingesting
matter and information—while white holes are interpreted as transient, reactive ejection
events akin to the anus of cosmic spacetime. The singularity serves as the compressive
digestive core, and Hawking radiation manifests as a thermodynamic burp.
Framed as a conceptual alternative to static white hole models, CBH posits that white
holes emerge only when sufficient gravitational “mass-pressure” accumulates, mimicking
pressure-activated expulsion in biological systems. This mechanism offers an intuitive
metaphor for resolving the black hole information paradox, positioning information as the
fibre of the universe—necessary for maintaining spacetime regularity and avoiding
cosmic constipation.
We explore connections to loop quantum gravity, bounce cosmology, and the possibility
that our own universe was seeded by the white hole ejection of a previous black hole
system. While CBH is semi-satirical, it provides a pedagogically useful lens for
communicating entropy flow, cosmic recycling, and the irrepressible urge of the universe
to relieve itself. If future anomalies such as sudden high-entropy ejections, primordial
gamma bursts, or spontaneous spacetime "hiccups" are observed, CBH offers one
explanation:
The universe passed something.
