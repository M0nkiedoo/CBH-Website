<p>The long-standing theorem in black hole physics declares that “black holes have no
hair.” That is, they erase the fine details of anything that falls into them, preserving only
mass, charge, and spin. They are smooth, clean, and characterless. In the language of
the Cosmic Bowel Hypothesis, they are the clean-shaven voids of the universe.
But what of their explosive, chaotic counterparts? If white holes are the wild expulsive
events born of gravitational indigestion, perhaps they are not smooth at all. Perhaps they
are... hairy.

White holes, in contrast to their bald cousins, may release tangled streams of
information, matter, radiation, and unresolved entropy. Like a beard of unprocessed
identity, they spew quantum chaos and unresolved gravitational trauma. If black holes
are the bald heads of spacetime, white holes are the bearded rebels—full of messy
secrets the cosmos couldn't hold in.

<p>
We propose, then, the Hair Hypothesis Addendum:
- **Black holes** are bald: clean, compressed, and emotionally unavailable.  - **White holes** are hairy: chaotic, expressive, and desperate to unload.  In the end, perhaps it is this follicular asymmetry that makes the universe dynamic. After
all, even spacetime needs to let its hair down.
