2. The Anatomy of Spacetime Digestion

In the CBH Model, the dynamics of black holes and their hypothetical white hole
counterparts are mapped onto the functional anatomy of a digestive tract. While the
analogy is playful, it offers a surprisingly cohesive model of input, transformation,
storage, pressure buildup, and eventual expulsion.
	
	2.1. The Black Hole — The Mouth:

Like the beginning of a digestive system, the black hole serves as the intake port. Matter,
energy, light, and information are pulled across the event horizon, never to return. The
event horizon functions like a sphincter or one-way valve, allowing inflow but preventing
any exit.

	2.2. The Singularity — The Stomach:

The singularity represents the most extreme condition of compression, reducing matter
to its most fundamental states.2.3. Hawking Radiation — The Burp:
Hawking radiation provides a thermodynamic release valve. It’s weak and slow—like gas
escaping over time.

	2.4. The White Hole — The Anus:

When enough gravitational “mass-pressure” builds, a white hole event emerges,
expelling restructured matter in an explosive, time-reversed flow.

	2.5. The Wormhole Hypothesis — The Intestine:

In CBH terms, this is the intestine—a transit tube that processes compressed matter into
a more stable, ejection-ready form.

	2.6. The Information Paradox — The Fibre Question:

If white holes eject previously compressed contents, they may resolve the information
paradox—not by preventing information loss, but by delaying its return until the ejection
event.
