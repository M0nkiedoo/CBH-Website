<p>The author is not a physicist, astrophysicist, or theoretical mathematician—and he’s
perfectly happy with that. He is a deeply curious, imaginative amateur cosmologist with a
lifelong fascination for how the universe works (and occasionally doesn’t). </p>

<p>Guided by instinct, humour, and the occasional moustache, The author approaches cosmic questions sideways—where metaphor meets meaning and science meets satire.
Though untrained in academic physics, The author brings a grounded logic, a sharp wit,
and an uncanny ability to link complex ideas with real-world analogies.</p>

<p>‘The Cosmic Bowel Hypothesis’ began as a half-serious comment and quickly evolved into a fully-formed speculative framework for understanding black holes, white holes, and the
thermodynamic digestion of spacetime.</p>

<p>In doing so, he carved out a space for himself in
that glorious territory between nonsense and genius—one beard stroke at a time.
When he’s not philosophising about entropy, The author enjoys landscape design,
rewilding, musing about consciousness, and occasionally wondering if his own universe
was passed by another.</p>
