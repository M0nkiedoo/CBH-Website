4. The Information Paradox, Fibre, and Spacetime Regularity

At the heart of black hole thermodynamics lies the information paradox. In CBH, this
becomes: does the universe get enough fibre?

4.1. Information = Fibre:
Information helps transport and retain structure. Without enough of it, black holes
accumulate unrelieved entropy.

4.2. White Holes as Information Restorers:
White holes may return scrambled quantum states—like waste still containing the trace
of its source.

4.3. Spacetime Regularity:
Singularities are the breakdowns of structure—CBH suggests this is due to irregular
information flow and lack of connective topologies.

4.4. Quantum Flatulence:
Hawking radiation may represent quantum burps—tiny bits of information escaping over
long durations.
